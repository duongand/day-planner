### Summary
Have you ever felt unproductive halfway through the day? Did you nap for more than the recommended 30 minuntes? `day-planner` is an easy tool to plan out your day and grasp change. A laid out plan alleviates the guessing and feeling of what should be done. Nothing is more satisfying than knowing that incremental progression was made.

The project takes advantage of event delegation to apply event listeners to new elements as new tasks are being added without routinely iterating through each list item. The application also uses local storage to retain all added tasks for the day.
